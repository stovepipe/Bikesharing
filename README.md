# Bikesharing Analysis

August 2019 CitiBike usage data visualization with Tableau

## Overview of the Analysis

A bike trip plausability analysis for Des Moines, Iowa using Citi Bike data from August 2019 in New York City. The analysis utilizes user trip data to determine peak usage times and customer demographics. Assuming that, while scaled, the New York City data represents what could happen in Des Moines, this analysis will demonstrate proof of concept for the new location launch.

## Summary

### Conclusion

Des Moines is an urban cityscape with a gap in the bicycle rental market. This analysis has shown bike usage trends and further expanded into demographic data to allow for further analysis with Des Moines' population. If the company is launched, this analysis provides insight into the peak usage times and customer types to allow for better resource allocation and asset management, key initiatives for a start-up. Knowing these results, it is our hope that investors accept the plausibility of a bikesharing program in Des Moines.

### Additional Visualizations

1) Compare trip length in Des Moines to trip length in New York City. Determine the average trip length and see if similar conditions can be recreated in Des Moines between housing areas and business areas of the city. 
2) Des Moines is considerably smaller than New York City. Given that males dominate the usage, using US Census data, compare Des Moines gender demographics to New York City and find scale of use in Des Moines if trip conditions could be recreated.
